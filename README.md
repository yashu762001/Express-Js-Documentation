<h3> The react native application is made using the expo client. Expo client makes it easy for debugging the code and see how the application looks on the actual mobile phone. </h3>

<h3> Although you may check the application on the mobile simulator also but for that there are several things to be downloaded on the laptop. </h3>

<p> This todo app made by me does not store anything,  As you go offline and come back online all the data would be lost since nothing is being stored on any database. </p>

<p> I have made this app just for learning how react native works and also study the different tools it provides for development. </p>

<h2> Installation procedure : </h2>

<ul>

<li> First install node js in your laptop </li>
<li> After that go to cmd (if you are a windows user) and type npm install expo --global </li>
<li> Just to verify if expo is installed or not type expo --version, if error occurs then it is not installed so try agin </li>
<li> After that type on cmd expo init first app(First app is not necessary, this name is up to you) </li>
<li> After that open the project folder in any ide </li>
<li> Now comes how to debug code or see app on web plus mobile phone. </li>
<li> Type npm start on ide terminal </li>
<li> A default server will start at localhost:19002/19003 </li>
<li> To watch app on mobile download expo client app in your mobile phone. After that scan the qr present on the port 19002/19003. </li>
<li> A animation showing installation of javascript bundles would appear. Wait for a while, and your app would start working. </li>

</ul>
